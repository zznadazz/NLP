2. Split the train set into Training, Validation, & validation sets (0.75, 0.21), the test set is a separate file here.
3. Cleaned Textual Data
4. Vectorized Texts (one hot encoder, tfidf, embeddings (word2vec with gensim, ELMO, BERT, GPT, etc.))
5. ML Classification models and DL model or an ensemble of several ML/DL or both ML and DL models
6. Chose and justified the choice of the evaluation metric
7. Hyperparameter optimization (Cross validation - hyperopt - Gridsearch)
8. Evaluated on Test set
9. Used Lime to explain one text classification
10. Used Shapley to explain globally the text classification
